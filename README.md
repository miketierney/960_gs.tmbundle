A bundle of useful snippets and tools for working with the [960.gs](http://960.gs) framework while using [TextMate](http://macromates.com/).

### Why? ###
Well, in short, there wasn't a bundle out there that works like I need it to. This bundle contains snippets that make writing markup that incorporates the 960 framework a lot easier (and with many fewer keystrokes).

### Snippets ###

_**NOTE:** All snippets are tab activated._

`clc`     ->     `class="container_xx"`  
`clg`     ->      `class="grid_xx"`  

`clga`    ->      `class="grid_xx alpha"`  
`clgo`    ->      `class="grid_xx omega"`  
`clgao`   ->      `class="grid_xx alpha omega"`  

`cla`     ->      `class="alpha"`  
`clo`     ->      `class="omega"`  

`c`     ->      `container_xx `  
`g`     ->      `grix_xx `  
`al`     ->      `alpha `  
`om`     ->      `omega `   


If you run in to any issues (or conflicts with the Tab Activators), please open an issue in the reposity (or let me know at mike [at] panpainter [dot] com). Thanks!
